  Analyze the current working-tree changes (staged + unstaged), group them into appropriately-scoped commits with the project's prefix convention (Feat / Fix / Refactor / Perf / Docs / Test / Build / CI / Chore / Style / Revert), and execute each commit in Japanese after user approval. Use it whenever changes are ready to be committed — 「コミットして」「変更をまとめて」. Respects `CLAUDE.md`'s git rules, and warns when the current branch's PR is already merged so a fresh branch is cut first. Do NOT use it to push or open a PR (`submit-pr`).

# Commit

You have been invoked via `/commit`. Argument string: `$ARGUMENTS`

A Japanese reference translation of this skill is available at `SKILL.ja.md` in the same directory (not loaded as a skill; for human reference only).

This command analyzes uncommitted changes in the working tree and produces one or more git commits with appropriate granularity and the project's prefix convention. All commit messages are in Japanese, per `CLAUDE.md`.

This command intentionally bypasses lefthook on every commit (`git commit --no-verify`) so that pre-commit checks (`make go-lint` / `make go-test` / `make sql-lint` / migration checks) do not fire N times during multi-commit splits. Instead, after all commits succeed, Step 6 runs the whole pre-commit hook once via `lefthook run pre-commit --force` plus `make go-fix` as a single verification pass. The `--force` flag is what makes this work: after this command stages and commits everything the working tree is clean, so a bare `lefthook run pre-commit` would skip every command ("no matching staged files") — `--force` runs the hook anyway. Driving the real hook keeps the gate in sync with `.lefthook.yaml` and runs the commands in parallel.

## Step 0. Auto-format

Run `make gate-fix` once at the very start to absorb formatting fixes (gofmt / goimports / auto-fixable lint rules). This removes the most common source of noise from the subsequent diff inspection and reduces the chance the Step 6 verification fails on pure formatting.

```sh
make gate-fix
```

`gate-fix` rather than `fix`, because this runs on every `/commit` and `fix` drives the same full-config golangci-lint as `lint`. `.makefiles/load.mk` therefore defers it in the `ci-first` band along with the other heavy gates (`repo-ops` §19) and CI's lint reports the formatting drift instead. A bare `make go-fix` still runs unconditionally — an explicitly typed command does what it says.

If `make gate-fix` itself fails, abort and report the failure to the user. Do not continue. Any changes it produces are folded into the working tree and become part of the candidate change set inspected in Step 2. When the band deferred it, it produces no changes by design — do not read that as evidence the tree was already formatted.

## Step 1. Pre-flight Checks

Run these in parallel:

```sh
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD                      # current branch
git rev-parse HEAD                                   # current HEAD commit (save as ORIGINAL_HEAD)
git status --porcelain                               # staged + unstaged
git diff --shortstat                                 # unstaged summary
git diff --staged --shortstat                        # staged summary
git rev-parse --verify MERGE_HEAD 2>/dev/null        # detect ongoing merge
git rev-parse --verify CHERRY_PICK_HEAD 2>/dev/null  # detect ongoing cherry-pick
git rev-parse --verify REBASE_HEAD 2>/dev/null       # detect ongoing rebase
```

Save the current HEAD commit hash as `ORIGINAL_HEAD`. This is the rollback target if anything fails during Step 5.

Bail out (do not commit) if any of the following:

- Current branch matches `^(production|develop|staging|release/.+)$`. Per `CLAUDE.md` git rules, never commit to protected branches. Inform the user and ask them to create a feature branch first (e.g., `feature/<issue-or-topic>`).
- Both staged and unstaged porcelain outputs are empty. Tell the user there is nothing to commit and stop.
- Any of `MERGE_HEAD` / `CHERRY_PICK_HEAD` / `REBASE_HEAD` is set. The repository is mid-operation; ask the user to resolve that first.

### Merged-PR check (recommend a fresh branch when the current branch's PR is already merged)

After the branch passes the protected-branch bail-out, check whether the current branch already has an associated pull request that has been **merged**. Adding new commits onto a branch whose PR is already merged is almost always unintended — the commits would pile up on a dead branch that no longer flows into its base, and a later `submit-pr` would try to reopen / update a merged PR.

Run (gh CLI; degrade gracefully when `gh` is missing, unauthenticated, or there is no remote — in that case skip this check and continue):

```sh
gh pr view --json number,state,mergedAt,baseRefName,headRefName,url 2>/dev/null
```

Interpret the result:

- **No PR found, or `gh` unavailable** → continue normally (no action).
- **`state` is `OPEN`** → normal "existing PR branch" case. Continue; Step 7 already enforces the ask-before-push rule for PR branches.
- **`state` is `MERGED`** (or `mergedAt` is non-null) → STOP before committing and use `AskUserQuestion` to recommend cutting a new branch from the (latest) base:
  - Question: 「現在のブランチ `<headRefName>` は PR #`<number>` が既にマージ済みです。このままコミットすると、base に流れない死んだブランチに積み増しになります。新しいブランチを切って作業しますか？」
  - Options:
    - 「新しいブランチを切る（推奨）」 — propose a branch name derived from the pending change (e.g. `feature/<topic>`), confirm it, then refresh the base and switch:

      ```sh
      BASE=$(make -s base-branch)
      test -n "$BASE" || { echo "ベースブランチを解決できませんでした"; exit 1; }
      git fetch origin "$BASE"
      git switch -c <new-branch> "origin/$BASE"
      ```

      The base here is the **current** active release line, which `make base-branch` resolves from `origin`'s live state — not the merged PR's `baseRefName`. That field records the line the old work merged into, and a release line may well have opened since; branching off it would start the new work one generation behind. This is also why `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef` is not the answer: the GitHub default branch lags behind the active line too. Note that `git switch -c … origin/release/*` sets the new branch's upstream to the **protected** base, so the eventual push must use an explicit refspec (`git push -u origin <new-branch>`), never a bare `git push` (which would target the protected base). The uncommitted working-tree changes carry over to the new branch; continue the normal flow (Step 2 onward) on it. **Exception:** under `--dry-run`, do not switch branches — only surface the warning and the recommended command, then proceed with the dry-run proposal.
    - 「このブランチのまま続ける」 — the user accepts committing on the merged branch; continue on the current branch.
- **`state` is `CLOSED`** (closed without merge) → not blocked, but note it to the user once (the branch's PR was closed) and continue.

Read `.lefthook.yaml` (if present) and extract the list of `pre-commit:` command entries. The list is displayed in Step 4 so the user knows what is being skipped during the split; Step 6 then re-runs the whole hook via `lefthook run pre-commit --force`. If `.lefthook.yaml` is absent, note that and continue (Step 6 will fall back to running only `make go-fix`).

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--dry-run` | Produce the grouping proposal but do not stage or commit. |
| `--scope=staged` | Only consider currently-staged changes. |
| `--scope=all` | Consider both staged and unstaged (default). |

## Step 2. Inspect Changes

Collect detailed diffs to understand the nature of each change:

```sh
git diff --staged                     # full staged diff
git diff                              # full unstaged diff
git diff --staged --name-only
git diff --name-only
```

Treat the following as **rider files** — they never form their own commit, but ride along with the source change that produced them:

- Generated files: `**/*.gen.go`, `**/*.sql.go`, `*_mock.go`, `**/openapi.gen.yaml`, generated content under `docs/portal/guides/`
- Vendored content: `vendor/**`

Example: an `openapi/**/*.yaml` change brings its `*.gen.go` outputs with it in the same commit. A `database/dml/**/*.sql` change brings its `internal/infrastructure/rdb/sqlc/gen/*.gen.go` outputs in the same commit.

## Step 3. Prefix Reference

Use exactly **one** of the following prefixes per commit (capitalized, English, colon-suffixed):

| Prefix | Purpose | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Feat:` | New feature, new endpoint, new migration | New handler, new API in `openapi/`, new SQL under `database/migrations/` |
| `Fix:` | Bug fix (correcting behavior that deviates from intent) | Error-handling fix, logic correction |
| `Refactor:` | Internal cleanup without changing external behavior | Function split, rename, responsibility move, layer reorganization |
| `Perf:` | Performance improvement | Query optimization, N+1 elimination, allocation reduction |
| `Docs:` | Documentation change | `README*`, `docs/`, `*.ja.md`, code comments, release notes |
| `Test:` | Adding or fixing tests | `*_test.go`, test fixtures, test helpers |
| `Build:` | Build system, dependencies, tooling | `Dockerfile`, `go.mod` / `go.sum`, `makefile`, `.makefiles/**`, `mise.toml` |
| `CI:` | CI/CD configuration | `.github/workflows/**`, `.lefthook.yaml`, GitHub Actions related |
| `Chore:` | Miscellaneous chores | `.gitignore`, editor settings, `.claude/**`, other small tasks |
| `Style:` | Formatting-only changes that do not affect logic | Output of `make go-fix`, `gofmt`, `goimports` |
| `Revert:` | Undoing an existing commit | Output of `git revert`, or an equivalent manual revert |

Do not invent prefixes outside this list. When ambiguous, choose the closest match (most cases are one of `Feat` / `Fix` / `Refactor`).

### Path-based hints

| Path pattern | Candidate prefix |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/**/*.go` (non-test) | `Feat` / `Fix` / `Refactor` / `Perf` (judge from the diff) |
| `**/*_test.go` | `Test` |
| `openapi/**/*.yaml` | `Feat` (API change) |
| `database/migrations/**/*.sql` | `Feat` (schema change) |
| `database/dml/**/*.sql` | `Feat` / `Refactor` (new query vs. cleanup) |
| `docs/**/*.md`, `README*.md`, `*.ja.md` | `Docs` |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker/**`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `makefile`, `.makefiles/**`, `mise.toml` | `Build` |
| `.github/workflows/**`, `.lefthook.yaml` | `CI` |
| `.gitignore`, `.claude/**`, editor settings | `Chore` |

## Step 4. Propose Grouping

Build a list of proposed commits with appropriate granularity. Each item:

```txt
[N] <Prefix>: <short Japanese title>
    files:
      - path/to/file1
      - path/to/file2
    rationale: <why these belong in one commit>
```

### Granularity guidance

- **One semantic change = one commit.** Do not mix feature + refactor + fix into a single commit.
- **Tests may co-locate with the implementation they cover** (a new handler and its tests belong together). If you are only adding tests for existing code, that goes into a standalone `Test:` commit.
- **Generated artifacts co-locate with their source change.** When `openapi/*.yaml` changes, the regenerated `*.gen.go` files belong in the same commit. The output of `make gen-api` / `make gen-query` follows the same rule.
- **Formatting-only changes are standalone `Style:` commits.** Output produced by Step 0's `make go-fix` may be folded into the appropriate existing group when it is clearly part of the same change; if it is unrelated, surface it as a separate `Style:` commit.
- **`Docs:` is standalone by default.** Exception: when documentation is part of a new feature (e.g., a README added alongside a new package), they may co-locate.
- **One prefix per commit.** If you feel the urge to write two, the grouping is wrong.

### Lefthook notice

Along with the grouping proposal, display the lefthook commands that will be **skipped** during the commit phase but **re-run together in Step 6** via `lefthook run pre-commit --force` as a verification gate. Read them dynamically from `.lefthook.yaml` (the list is configuration, not hardcoded). Example output when the current config defines lint/test/sql-lint/migration checks:

```txt
This command will run `git commit --no-verify` on every commit.
The following lefthook pre-commit commands will be SKIPPED during commits but
re-run together in Step 6 via `lefthook run pre-commit --force` after all commits succeed:
  - lint                    (make go-lint)
  - test                    (make go-test)
  - sql-lint                (make sql-lint)
  - migration-check-version (make check-migration-up-version check-migration-down-version)
  - migration-check-gap     (make check-migration-up-gap check-migration-down-gap)
Plus `make go-fix` as a final formatting pass.
```

### Confirmation

Confirm the proposal via `AskUserQuestion`:

- Question: 「提案したコミット分割でよいですか？」
- Options: 「この提案で進める」 / 「修正したい箇所を指摘する」

When `--dry-run` is set, print the proposal and stop. Do not stage or commit.

## Step 5. Execute Each Commit

For each approved group, run the following in order:

```sh
# Stage only the files belonging to this group (never use -A / .)
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2

# HEREDOC is required (preserves the title / blank line / body / footer layout).
# --no-verify is intentional: lefthook is bypassed by design (see Step 4 notice).
git commit --no-verify -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<Prefix>: <short Japanese title>

<Optional body: what changed and why>

Co-Authored-By: Claude {running model} <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

### Commit message rules

- **Title**: `<Prefix>: <Japanese title>`, aim for 50 characters or fewer.
- **Body**: Optional. If present, leave one blank line after the title and wrap around 72 characters. Prefer "why" over "what".
- **Language**: Japanese (per the output rule in `CLAUDE.md`).
- **`Co-Authored-By` footer**: Required. `Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>`, where `<model>` is the identity of the model actually executing the commit, as the harness states it (e.g. `Opus 5 (1M context)`) — never guessed. Do not write a version number into this file: it would be the same fact in two places, and the copy nobody re-reads is the one that goes stale.
- **`Refs:` footer (review-applied commits only)**: when a commit applies a finding from `full-apply` / `impl-review` / `code-review` (the change traces back to a review ledger), add a `Refs: <reviews-dir>/mod_*.md (<severity>)` line in the footer so the commit links to the finding. Omit it for ordinary commits.
- **HEREDOC**: Required (keeps the title + blank line + body + footer layout intact).
- **`--no-verify`**: Required for every commit produced by this command. This is an explicit, command-scoped carve-out from the project-wide rule; the rationale is documented in Step 4 (lefthook is run once manually before push, not N times during the split).
- **Never use `-a`, `git add -A`, or `git add .`.** Always stage files by name (avoids sweeping in `.env` or credentials).
- **`--no-gpg-sign` and `--amend` remain prohibited** (`--amend` is also hard-blocked by `permissions.deny`). To revise the last commit, `git reset` (mixed — never `--hard`) to unstage everything, then re-`git add` the intended files and recommit; a bare `git reset --soft` can leave stale index entries, so prefer the mixed reset + explicit re-add.

### Error handling

If `git add` or `git commit` fails for any group (file-path typo, mid-operation state that slipped through pre-flight, GPG signing failure, etc.):

1. Stop further commits immediately. Do not continue with the next group.
2. Report to the user:
   - Which group failed (`[k]` index and proposed title)
   - The captured stderr from the failed command
   - The commits already created in this session: `git log --oneline <ORIGINAL_HEAD>..HEAD`
3. Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask how to recover:
   - Question: 「ここまでに作成したコミットをどうしますか？」
   - Options:
     - 「ロールバックする (`git reset --mixed <ORIGINAL_HEAD>`)」 — rewinds HEAD to the saved `ORIGINAL_HEAD`, leaves all changes in the working tree, clears the index
     - 「そのまま残して停止する」 — keep the partial commits and hand control back to the user
4. If the user chooses rollback, run `git reset --mixed <ORIGINAL_HEAD>` and confirm with `git status` and `git log --oneline -n 3`. Never use `--hard`.

## Step 6. Verification

After all commits succeed, run the full lefthook `pre-commit` hook once with `lefthook run pre-commit --force`, then `make go-fix` as a final formatting pass. The `--force` flag is essential: the commits were made with `--no-verify` and the working tree is now clean, so a bare `lefthook run pre-commit` skips every command ("no matching staged files"); `--force` runs the whole hook regardless of staging. Driving the real hook (instead of a hand-enumerated command list) keeps this gate in sync with `.lefthook.yaml` — newly added `pre-commit` commands are picked up automatically — and lefthook runs them in parallel (`parallel: true`), which is much faster than a sequential re-run.

The hook decides for itself how hard to run. `.makefiles/load.mk` sizes the heavy Go gates from the number of open worktrees, and in the `ci-first` band it defers them to CI rather than running them here (`make load-status` reports the current band; `repo-ops` §19 explains it). Do not fight that decision by invoking `make go-lint` / `make go-test` directly to "really" verify — with several windows open, a full local lint costs minutes of saturated host and CI re-runs it identically anyway. Report what the band did and let the push carry the rest.

### Procedure

0. Run `make -s load-status` and note the resolved band. It tells you, before anything runs, whether the heavy gates will execute locally (`full` / `low`) or be deferred to CI (`ci-first`), so the summary in step 4 can say which verification actually happened.
1. Run `lefthook run pre-commit --force`. It executes every command under `pre-commit.commands.*` against the working tree (which reflects the committed state) and exits non-zero if any command fails. If `.lefthook.yaml` is absent or `lefthook` is not installed, skip to step 3 (run only `make go-fix`) and note it.
2. Read lefthook's per-command summary — it lists each command with ✔️ / ❌ and a timing.
3. Run `make gate-fix`. If it modifies any tracked file, surface the diff to the user — it indicates the committed state was not fully formatted, and the user must decide whether to stage and commit those fixes.
4. Summarize the outcome to the user: lefthook's pass/fail summary (or the note that lefthook was unavailable) plus whether `make go-fix` produced changes. When the band was `ci-first`, say plainly which gates were deferred and that CI is what verifies them — a summary that reads "検証が通りました" without that qualifier overstates what was checked.
5. If `lefthook run pre-commit --force` exits non-zero (any command failed), report the failing command (from lefthook's summary) and stop. Do NOT roll back commits — the failure is informational; the user decides whether to add fix-up commits or amend. Tell the user explicitly:

   ```txt
   検証で失敗があります。push 前に修正してください。
   失敗したコマンド: <lefthook が ❌ を出したコマンド名>
   ```

6. If lefthook passes and `make go-fix` produced no changes, proceed to Step 7.

> The repo's `pre-commit` commands are whole-repo `make` targets, so `--force` (which feeds an empty / `{all_files}` set) runs them correctly. If a future command relies on the `{staged_files}` template, revisit this — `--force` would pass it no files.

### Skipping verification

If the user passes `--no-verify` to `/commit` itself (a future-compatible flag), or if `.lefthook.yaml` is absent, skip this step entirely and note it in the Step 7 report. The default behavior is to run verification.

## Step 7. Push Policy and Final Reminder

- **Do not auto-push** (per `CLAUDE.md` git rules).
- After Step 6 finishes (whether all checks passed or not), report to the user. The template depends on the verification outcome:

  When all checks passed:

  ```txt
  N 件のコミットを作成し、検証コマンドも全て成功しました。
  プッシュは手動で実行してください: `git push`
  ```

  When the resolved band was `ci-first`:

  ```txt
  N 件のコミットを作成しました。重い Go ゲートと自動フォーマットは CI へ委譲されています。
  push 後に CI の結果を確認してください。ローカルでは重いゲートを実行していません。
  ```

  When some checks failed:

  ```txt
  N 件のコミットを作成しましたが、Step 6 の検証で失敗があります。
  失敗内容を修正してから push してください。
  ```

  When verification was skipped (no `.lefthook.yaml` or explicit skip):

  ```txt
  N 件のコミットを作成しました（検証はスキップしました）。
  push 前に手動で動作確認してください。
  ```

- When working on an existing PR branch, follow `CLAUDE.md` and ask before pushing:
  「変更はローカルにコミット済みです。これらの変更をプルリクエストにプッシュしますか？」

## Constraints (Summary)

- ❌ Direct commits to `production` / `develop` / `staging` / `release/*` branches
- ❌ Auto-running `git push` / `git push --force` / `git reset --hard` / `git checkout --` / `git clean -f`
- ❌ `--no-gpg-sign` / `--amend`
- ❌ `git add -A` / `git add .` / `git commit -a` (always name files explicitly)
- ❌ Mixing multiple prefixes in one commit
- ❌ Committing without `--no-verify` (would run lefthook N times)
- ✅ Japanese commit messages
- ✅ HEREDOC for the message
- ✅ `Co-Authored-By` footer
- ✅ `--no-verify` on every commit produced by this command
- ✅ Stage only the files in the current group
- ✅ `make go-fix` once at Step 0 before inspection
- ✅ Capture `ORIGINAL_HEAD` at Step 1 for safe rollback
- ✅ At Step 1, detect a current branch whose PR is already merged (`gh pr view`) and recommend cutting a fresh branch from the base before committing (degrade gracefully when `gh` is unavailable)
- ✅ On failure, propose `git reset --mixed <ORIGINAL_HEAD>` via `AskUserQuestion`
- ✅ Step 6 runs the whole pre-commit hook via `lefthook run pre-commit --force` + `make go-fix`
- ✅ Always pass `--force` to `lefthook run pre-commit` in Step 6 — without it, lefthook skips every command against the now-clean post-commit tree
