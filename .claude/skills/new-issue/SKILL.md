  Turn a question about a possible change into a GitHub issue whose premises have been verified against the actual implementation — or into the finding that it should not be an issue at all. Use whenever the user wonders aloud whether something is feasible, reports behavior they think is wrong, proposes a refactor, or asks 「これ issue にしといて」「これって直せる？」「こういう機能入れられる？」. The value is not drafting prose: it is tracing the request path end to end before asserting anything, refusing to guess when information is missing, and writing each factual claim so it is individually falsifiable later. Filing is gated behind "should this be an issue at all" — an existing issue that only needs a comment, or a fix small enough to just make, is not a new issue. Do NOT use it to work an issue that already exists (`impl-issue`), to review a diff (`impl-review`), or to write an ADR (`docs/adr/` —— **supersede は停止点である**).

# New Issue

Convert a question about a possible change into an issue that can be trusted later — or into the
conclusion that no issue is warranted.

The drafting is the easy part. What this skill exists for is the step before it: **checking that what
you are about to assert is true of the code as it stands right now**, and refusing to fill gaps with
plausible guesses. An issue is read months later by someone who will act on it; a confident sentence
that was never verified costs more than no issue at all.

not loaded as a skill).

## When to Use

- The user wonders whether something is feasible, or proposes a change in passing.
- The user reports behavior they believe is wrong.
- The user asks for an issue outright.

Do NOT use it to work an issue that already exists (`impl-issue`), to review a diff (`impl-review` /
`test-review`), or to write an ADR (`docs/adr/`).

## Why this exists

An issue's factual claims are usually wrong for one reason: nobody looked outside the layer they were
thinking about. A status code, an event's consumer, the cost of an option on the hot path — each is
statically checkable, and each is decided somewhere the author never opened. That is the failure this
skill is shaped around. Reading "the relevant layer" is not the same as tracing the path.

## Step 0 — Confirm two things (one `AskUserQuestion`)

**Verification depth** — how far a behavioral claim must be proven before filing.

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `runtime` *(default when the draft asserts runtime behavior)* | Confirm the behavior against the running system before filing |
| `static` | Code reading only; every behavioral claim is then marked as unverified in the body |

**Output** — whether this run ends in a filed issue or a handed-over draft.

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `file` *(default)* | Present the body, then file after approval |
| `draft` | Produce the body and the analysis; file nothing |

Searching existing issues is not a mode. It always happens — it is cheap, and skipping it is how a
duplicate gets filed.

## Step 1 — Capture the question

Restate what the user is actually asking, in one or two sentences, and confirm it. A question asked in
passing ("これ直せる？") usually carries an unstated assumption about *where* the problem is; naming
that assumption early is what lets Step 2 disprove it.

Record what triggered this: a symptom the user hit, a review finding, a code reading. The origin
determines how much of it is already evidence and how much is conjecture.

## Step 2 — Trace the path end to end

This is the step the skill exists for. Do not read only the layer the question points at.

For a behavioral question, follow the request from entry to storage and back:

```txt
宣言（mise.toml / *.toml / scripts/lib/*）→ 生成器 → 生成先 → 検査（make *-check）→ hook / CI → 必須 context → merge
```

**最も飛ばされ、最も決定的なのは検査の段である** —— 検査が対象を失っていれば、その先は全部
緑になる。構造の問いなら依存の向きを辿り、規則は `docs/adr/README.md` から所有する ADR を開いて
実行時に読む。**記憶から答えない。**

Then establish, for each thing you intend to assert:

- **Is it current?** The file may have changed in a branch that merged this week. Check recent history
  for the paths involved (`git log --oneline -15 -- <paths>`) and recently merged PRs touching them.
- **Is the radius complete?** 「X だけがこれをやっている」は**不在についての主張**である。
  数えた範囲を言わない限り成立しない —— `grep -rn '<symbol>' scripts/` と
  `go -C scripts list ./...` で区分を並べ、**どこまで見たかを添える**。構造で引く索引は
  このリポジトリにまだ無いので、代わりが網羅的な検索である。
- **Does a cost comparison rest on anything?** "Adds a read on the hot path" is checkable — count the
  queries in both designs. An unmeasured cost is not a trade-off, it is a guess.

`AGENTS.md` の *正典となる文書* と `scripts/README.md` を読んで該当箇所を特定する。
**パスを推測しない。**

## Step 3 — Five blockers

A draft does not proceed to Step 4 while any of these is true. They are deliberately mechanical: an
author who is asked to *notice* that they are unsure will usually not notice.

| # | Blocker | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The draft asserts runtime behavior that was never executed | Run it (Step 5), or mark the claim unverified and say so in the body |
| 2 | Cited implementation was not checked for currency | Check history for those paths |
| 3 | An option comparison has no measured basis | Measure it, or drop the comparison and present the options without a cost claim |
| 4 | An impact-radius claim rests on a partial search | Reverse-traverse the graph, search exhaustively, or narrow the claim to what was covered |
| 5 | Existing issues were not searched | Search |

**When information is missing, ask — do not estimate.** This is the instruction the user gave when
asking for this skill, and it is worth stating plainly: a plausible guess written in an issue's
confident register becomes fact for everyone who reads it afterward. Missing information includes
which behavior is actually desired, which of several possible causes the user has in mind, and
whether a constraint the code implies is intentional. Ask about those; do not resolve them by
inference.

## Step 4 — Draft the body

Use the shape this repository's issues already use, plus a premises section:

```markdown
## 概要
## 前提            ← each factual claim, and where it was verified
## 背景
## やることリスト
## 論点            ← options A / B / C, each with cost and consequence, plus a recommendation and its basis
## やらないことリスト
## 完成の定義
## 関連
```

**The 前提 section is the part that is new, and it is the point.** Write each premise as a separate,
individually falsifiable statement with the evidence behind it:

```markdown
## 前提

- `<gate>` は対象0件のとき成功で返る — **verified**: 番兵が無い
  （`scripts/<tool>/main.go:NN`、`abc1234` 時点で確認）
- この必須 context を報告する job は存在しない — **verified**: 宣言の一覧と
  `gh pr checks` の突合で差分が出た（`abc1234` 時点）
- 同じパターンが2箇所に直接書かれている — **verified**: `grep -rn '<pattern>'` が
  `<path-a>` と `<path-b>` を返す（ADR-XXXX 決定N が禁じている形）
```

`impl-issue` reads this section when the issue is picked up and reports every premise that no longer
holds. Prose that buries its assumptions cannot be checked that way, which is exactly how the three
wrong claims above survived to implementation.

Two writing rules that keep an issue from rotting:

- **Cite symbols and paths, never line numbers.** Line numbers are stale by the next refactor, and a
  reader who follows one to the wrong place trusts what they find there.
- **Record the recommendation together with its basis.** A recommendation that turns out to be wrong
  is fine and normal; one whose reasoning is invisible cannot be overturned by evidence.

For a link to another repository's issue or PR, use `redirect.github.com` — a plain `github.com` link
posts a public cross-reference on that thread. Whether to send that signal deliberately is a human
decision, without exception: ask every time, and never make the call yourself. See `CLAUDE.md`.

Write the body in Japanese. Present it and wait for approval.

## Step 5 — Runtime confirmation (when the draft asserts behavior)

Under `--verify=runtime`, confirm the claims by **actually running the gate** before filing.
This is the same stage `impl-issue` runs before merging, for the same reason: 緑に見える出力と、
実際に見た出力は区別できない。

**このリポジトリに起動して叩ける API は無い。** 実行時の確認とは、主張しているゲートを走らせて
その出力を読むことである。

```bash
make <gate>-check            # 主張が「この検査が落ちる/落ちない」なら、走らせる
lefthook run pre-commit --force; echo "EXIT=$?"
gh pr checks <n>             # 主張が CI についてなら、実際の報告を見る
```

**「所見なし」を証拠にしない。** 件数か終了コードを確かめる（`repo-ops` §5）。
パイプで受けると終了コードが消えるので、`| tail` を挟んだ出力から合否を主張しない。

退化した入力を自分で作って確かめるのが、最も強い証拠である —— 対象0件のディレクトリ、
解釈できない構文、写しを1件増やす/減らす。それで落ちなければ、その検査は働いていない。

## Step 6 — Decide whether this should be an issue at all

Run this gate before filing. An AI that can write issues quickly will produce more of them than a
human would, and issue count is itself a cost — a duplicate buries the original, and a backlog nobody
can read is a backlog nobody uses.

| Situation | Action instead of filing |
| --- | --- |
| An existing issue covers it | Comment there with the new finding |
| The fix is small enough to just make | Offer to make it now |
| Step 2 disproved the premise | Report that; file nothing |
| It is a decision, not a task | ADR を提案する（`docs/adr/`。**supersede は停止点である** —— ADR-0001 決定2・3） |
| ユースケースの責務境界の話だった | `modules/<use-case>/README.md` の supported / unsupported へ（ADR-0102 決定7） |
| **Terraform 本体が無いと対象0件になる** | それを issue の本文に書く —— 何が要るか、入ったときに**どう変容するか** |

Search before concluding it is new:

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 100 --search "<keywords> in:title"
gh issue list --state all --limit 50 --search "<keywords>"
```

Include closed issues. A previously rejected proposal is important context, and re-filing it without
acknowledging the rejection wastes the reader's time.

State which branch of the table applied. Silence reads as "it was obviously an issue".

## Step 7 — File

```bash
gh label list --limit 40          # 実在するラベルだけを使う
gh issue create --title "<title>" --label <label> --body-file <file>
```

**issue テンプレートはこのリポジトリに無い**（.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ が存在しない）。
上の節構成がそのまま本文になる。**title と body は日本語**（ADR-0701 決定9）。

Report the URL, and say which premises were verified at runtime and which only statically.

If the user selected `--output=draft`, stop before this and hand over the body.

## Handoff to `impl-issue`

Upstream of this skill sits `research`, which compares undecided options and stops at
`決めるべきこと`. Its recommendation is not a decision — a human's approval is what turns it into one,
and this skill is where that approved outcome becomes trackable. When an issue arrives carrying a
recommendation nobody has approved yet, that is the gap to name, not to close: file the decision as
the 論点, not as a settled plan.

An issue produced here is meant to be picked up by `impl-issue`, whose first step compares the issue
against the base and reports every discrepancy in the kickoff comment. The 前提 section is what makes
that comparison possible. When drafting, write for that reader: state assumptions where they can be
checked, not where they read most smoothly.

## Do / Do NOT

- ✅ Trace the whole request path, including middleware, before asserting anything.
- ✅ Ask when information is missing; never fill the gap by inference.
- ✅ Write each premise as a separate falsifiable claim with its evidence.
- ✅ Search existing issues, closed ones included, before concluding it is new.
- ✅ Say explicitly which claims are unverified.
- ✅ Cite symbols and paths; record the recommendation's basis alongside it.
- ❌ Assert runtime behavior that was never executed, without labelling it as unverified.
- ❌ Present an unmeasured cost as a trade-off.
- ❌ Claim an impact radius from a partial search.
- ❌ File when an existing issue only needs a comment, or when the fix is smaller than the issue.
- ❌ Link another repository's issue with a plain `github.com` URL, or decide on your own that a
  cross-reference is warranted.
- ❌ Write line numbers into the body.
- ❌ Release the DB slot unprompted.
