  Compress an undecided design, technology, or operational question into a comparison a human can decide from — options scored on axes chosen for the question, a recommendation stated with its basis, and the conditions that would reverse it. Use whenever a choice is genuinely open and nobody has picked yet: which storage / library / pattern to use, where a responsibility belongs, whether to introduce an abstraction, how to shape a subsystem — 「A と B どっちが妥当？」「どう設計すべき？」「これって何を使うのが普通？」「選択肢を出して」. It first tries to dissolve the question: if an isomorphic mechanism already exists in this repository, it says so instead of manufacturing options. Read-only and decision-free — it produces `Decision required` and stops. Do NOT use it to establish what the repository currently does (`repo-truth` first — a comparison built on a wrong premise is worse than none), or to review a diff (`impl-review`).

# Research

Turn an open question into a decision a human can actually make — or into the finding that it was
never open.

## When to Use

- A design, technology, or operational choice is open and nobody has picked yet.
- Someone asks for options, or asks what the normal approach is.
- A decision is being reconsidered and needs its trade-offs laid out again.

Do NOT use it to establish what the repository currently does (`repo-truth` first), or to review a
diff (`impl-review` / `test-review` / `settle-comments`).

## Contract

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Owns** | 未決の比較、評価軸の確定、推奨とその反転条件、決めるべきことの提示 |
| **Never** | 採択 / ADR 承認 / 実装 / 案数合わせの選択肢捏造 / 出典・数値の捏造 |
| **Starts when** | 選択が開いていて、まだ誰も決めていないとき |
| **Stops when** | 現状が不明（`repo-truth` へ）、既に ADR / spec が決めている、外部情報を確認できない |

## Why this exists

Three failure modes make a comparison worse than no comparison, and all three look like diligence.

**The axes get reverse-engineered from the answer.** Once a preferred option exists, the criteria
that favour it are the ones that get written down. Fixing the axes first is the only defence, and it
has to happen before any option is named.

**Cost picks the answer.** "That would mean touching 30 files" quietly becomes the deciding argument.
`AGENTS.md`'s *What to Recommend* section is explicit that on this repository quality and consistency
outrank the cost of reaching them, and that the cost is stated so a human can decline the scope while
keeping the direction. Stating the cost is required; letting it choose is not.

**Evidence gets manufactured.** A benchmark number, a version, a "commonly recommended" — each is
easy to produce and hard to notice as invented. An unverified claim in a comparison's confident
register becomes the basis of a decision nobody can trace back.

There is also a fourth thing this skill exists to prevent, which is subtler: **answering a question
that was never open.** See Step 1.

## Arguments

| Argument | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--stage=full` *(default)* | Run through to a recommendation |
| `--stage=dissolve` | Run Steps 0-1 only and stop — is it already decided, is there an isomorphic precedent? |
| `--sources=repo` | Repo evidence only; make no external claim rather than an unverified one |
| `--sources=external` *(default)* | External lookup permitted, cited per the Sources section |
| `--axes=<csv>` | The caller fixes the evaluation axes; Step 2 adopts them instead of choosing |

`--stage=dissolve` is the cheap mode and often the whole answer: most questions that arrive here are
either settled already or structurally identical to something the codebase solved. Reach for it when
the ask is "is this even an open question?" — and report the dissolution as a result, not as a failure
to compare.

`--sources=repo` is the honest mode when lookup is unavailable. It is not a degraded run; it is a run
that declines to guess, and it must say which claims it therefore could not make.

## Step 0 — Establish that the question is actually open

A comparison built on a wrong premise about the current code is worse than no comparison, because it
looks decidable.

Before anything else, establish the current state — what exists, what constrains it, whether a
decision already stands in `docs/adr/` or `docs/design/`. If that state is unclear or contested,
**stop and say so**: the user should run `repo-truth` first. Do not invoke it yourself and do not
paper over the gap with an assumption, because the assumption then silently shapes every option.

If an ADR or spec already decides this, that is the answer. Report it, note whether the reasoning
still holds, and stop. Re-opening a settled decision is a human's call — `AGENTS.md` is explicit that
a precedent is not an authorization.

**Look for that decision by concern, not by keyword.** `AGENTS.md` states plainly that searching the
index for your feature's words is not enough, because a document is named for the concern it owns.
Read the entries in `docs/adr/README.md` —— **ADR の一覧が存在する唯一の場所** —— and pick by what
each one governs. 触っているユースケースがあるなら `modules/<use-case>/docs/adr/` も同じ拘束力を
持つ（ADR-0001 決定12-14）。 A decision missed this way does not
surface as an error — it surfaces as a comparison that re-litigates something already settled, which
is the most expensive output this skill can produce.

## Step 1 — Look for an isomorphic mechanism first

Before treating this as a design question, check whether the repository already solves a structurally
identical problem somewhere else. When it does, placement, construction, and call-site are already
decided by that precedent, and scoring options would be inventing a branch that does not exist.

This is the cheapest step and the most frequently skipped one. 運用機構なら `scripts/` の既存ツールを、
ユースケースなら同じ `modules/<use-case>/` の中を先に探す（`AGENTS.md` *作業手順* 3）。Read the owning
`README.md` at runtime rather than reasoning from the shape of the problem。

**重複のみを理由に共通化しないこと**（ADR-0205 決定11）**と、重複に気づかず二重に書くことは別である。**
この段が探しているのは後者である。

**An isomorphic mechanism is found by its shape, which means a keyword search will not find it.** It
solves a different domain problem with the same structure, so it shares no vocabulary with the
question — the precedent for a time window is a page cursor, and no search for "window" reaches it.
Enumerate what a layer actually contains and look at each one's shape; do not grep for the concept.

**構造で引く道具があれば、ここがその使いどころである** —— 問いと語を1つも共有しない先例は、
テキスト検索が構造的に届かない唯一の場合だからである。**そういう索引はこのリポジトリにまだ無い。**
無い以上、この段は列挙で代替する: 候補になる区分（`scripts/` のツール群、`modules/<use-case>/`）を
`ls` で並べ、1つずつ形を見る。**概念で grep しない** —— 届かないことが分かっている手段である。

Confirm any candidate in source before calling it isomorphic — 構造の近さは、同じ形の問題を解いて
いることを意味しない。構造の走査を回せなかったなら、そう言うこと —— 走らせられなかった走査は
「先例が無い」という主張を弱める側の事実である。

That asymmetry sets the burden of proof. "I found one" is verifiable by inspection, so it needs no
frontier. "There is none" is a claim about 150 packages you did not open, so say which layers were
enumerated — and if the sweep was partial, present the options as *provisional pending that check*
rather than asserting the branch is real.

Say plainly when it applies:

> 設計分岐なし。`<X>` は既存の `<Y>` と同型で、配置・構築・呼び出し位置はそちらの前例で確定する。

Scoring axes are what you reach for when this step finds nothing — and finding nothing is a claim
that has to be earned, because manufacturing a design branch that the codebase already settled is
exactly the failure this step exists to prevent.

## Step 2 — Fix the evaluation axes, then stop touching them

Choose the axes for *this* question and write them down before naming a single option.

This repository has a precedent worth starting from — 業界的正しさ / DDD 整合性 / アーキテクチャ純粋性
/ template 先の純粋性 — and it is a starting point, not a fixed rubric. A question about a build gate
does not have a DDD axis; a question about vocabulary is almost entirely the DDD one. Pick what the
question actually turns on, and say why each axis is there.

**Write down the axes you did not raise, too.** An axis can be absent because the question does not
turn on it, or because this run could not source it — `--sources=repo` removes the industry-practice
axis outright, and a reader who is shown four axes has no way to tell which of the two happened. The
comparison's shape is itself a claim about what mattered.

The last of those four is the one most easily forgotten and most often decisive: **this repository's
product is the state a project receives at `useTemplate` time**, not the history that produced it.
Weigh each option for someone who has never seen this repository and will never read its git log.
`AGENTS.md`'s *What to Recommend* section governs this.

## Step 3 — Enumerate options — the count is not the point

Enumerate the options the question actually has. Three is a common number and not a requirement:
a do-it / do-not question has two, and inventing a third to fill the shape produces a straw man that
makes the comparison look more considered than it is. A question with five genuinely distinct
approaches gets five; compress by merging near-duplicates, never by dropping one that differs.

Per option, and against the axes fixed in Step 2:

| Field | What it must contain |
| --- | --- |
| 案 | A name that says what it is, not "案 A" |
| 利点 / 欠点 | Consequences, not adjectives |
| リスク | Failure mode, migration, operational burden, security, lock-in |
| 既存構造との整合 | どの ADR の決定に触れるか、どこへ波及するか。トリップワイヤ（外部 module 依存 / Generic Escape Hatch / 安全側の設定を弱める）に当たらないか |
| コスト | Files touched, what breaks for whom, what must be regenerated — stated, never weighted into the verdict |

An unmeasured cost is not a trade-off, it is a guess. "Adds a read on the hot path" is checkable —
count the queries in both designs, or drop the claim. The same applies to blast radius: "touches
about 30 files" is a number the graph produces rather than estimates, so reverse-traverse from the
symbols each option would change (`node .claude/scripts/graph-affected.ts <symbol> --depth 2`) and
report what it returned.

When a cost genuinely could not be measured, it goes under `未確認` with what measuring it would
change — not into the cost field hedged with a qualifier. A hedged number still reads as a number,
and it is the one the reader carries into the decision.

## Step 4 — Recommend, and say what would reverse it

**Give a recommendation.** A comparison handed over without one returns the work to the person who
asked; on this repository the expectation is that the recommendation arrives with the options, not
after being asked for.

Then write the reversal conditions — the facts that, if different, would change the answer. This is
what makes a recommendation overturnable by evidence instead of by argument, and it is also the
honest record of what you were unsure about:

> この推奨は、`<前提>` が成り立つ限り。`<条件>` なら B が優位に転じる。

## Step 5 — Answer in this contract

Always this shape, in Japanese. Lead with the recommendation; the comparison is the support.

```markdown
## 問題
<何を決めようとしているか、1〜2 文>

## 前提
- <置いた仮定と、それが崩れたときの影響>

## 評価軸
- <軸> — <なぜこの問いでこの軸なのか>
- 立てなかった軸: <軸> — <なぜこの問いでは立てられない / 関係しないのか>

## 選択肢
### <案の名前>
- 利点 / 欠点 / リスク / 既存構造との整合 / コスト

## 推奨
<どれを、なぜ>

## 推奨が変わる条件
- <この事実が違えば結論が変わる>

## 未確認
- <測れなかったコスト / 確認できなかった主張> — <なぜ測れなかったか、測れば何が変わるか>

## 決めるべきこと
- <人間が決める事項> — 記録先: ADR / issue / spec のどれか

## 出典
- <発行主体> 「<資料名>」 <URL> （参照 <日付>）
```

When only part of the question could be researched, return that part and name the rest as
unresearched. A precise partial comparison beats a complete-looking one.

## Sources

Every external claim carries publisher, title, URL, and access date. Prefer primary and official
material — the project's own documentation, a specification, a release note — over secondary
summaries.

When lookup is unavailable, or a claim cannot be confirmed, **say it is unverified and lower the
confidence of anything resting on it**. Never produce a benchmark figure, a version number, a
deprecation date, or a citation you did not read. A fabricated source is not a small error here: it
is indistinguishable from a real one at the moment a decision is made, and it survives into the ADR.

For an in-repository claim, cite the path and the symbol, never a line number.

## Standalone by design

This skill produces `決めるべきこと` and stops. It does not adopt an option, write an ADR, file an
issue にする、あるいは実装に入る —— それを代わりに起動しない。

The gap between a recommendation and a decision is the whole point of the step. A recommendation that
flows straight into implementation was never reviewed by anyone; `AGENTS.md` puts architecture,
domain, and policy decisions behind a human gate precisely so that the option surviving to code is
one somebody chose. その先は人の承認であり、承認より前に実装へ入らない。

## Do / Do NOT

- ✅ Establish the current state first; stop and ask for `repo-truth` when it is unclear.
- ✅ Report an existing ADR / spec decision as the answer when one already stands.
- ✅ Search `docs/adr/README.md` by concern, never by the feature's words.
- ✅ Look for an isomorphic mechanism before treating the question as a design branch — by shape, by
  enumerating what a layer holds, not by grepping the concept.
- ✅ Traverse the graph for structural precedents and for blast radius, then confirm in source.
- ✅ Say which layers were enumerated before asserting no precedent exists; mark the options
  provisional when the sweep was partial or the graph was unavailable.
- ✅ Fix the evaluation axes before naming any option, and justify each axis — including the ones
  you did not raise, and why.
- ✅ Put a cost you could not measure under `未確認` with what measuring it would change, never
  into the cost field as a hedged number.
- ✅ Weigh options for the `useTemplate`-time reader, not for this repository's history.
- ✅ State cost plainly, as information, alongside the recommendation.
- ✅ Give a recommendation with its basis, and the conditions that reverse it.
- ✅ Cite publisher, title, URL, and access date for every external claim.
- ✅ Answer in Japanese.
- ❌ Manufacture an option to reach a target count, or drop one that genuinely differs.
- ❌ Choose the axes after the preferred option is known.
- ❌ Let cost decide the recommendation.
- ❌ Invent a benchmark, a version, a date, or a citation; present an unverified claim as verified.
- ❌ Adopt an option, write an ADR, file an issue, or implement anything.
- ❌ Assert that no precedent exists off a keyword search, or off layers you did not enumerate.
- ❌ Re-open a settled decision on your own initiative.
- ❌ Chain into `repo-truth`、あるいは実装を始めるスキル。
